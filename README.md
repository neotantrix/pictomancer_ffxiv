**THIS GUIDE INTENDED TO BE USED UP TO LEVEL 80 ONLY AND DOES NOT FACTOR IN ANYTHING BEYOND LEVEL 80**

**Pictomancer Basic Guide for Level 80:** <br>
So I sort of just pieced this together based on what I saw, felt, and read from other guides and other people.

**123 Combo** <br>
Picto's 123 combo begins with Fire in Red and cycles through two other spells as Aetherhue stacks accumulate. You get Aetherhue 1, then Aetherhue 2, then it disappears and you cast Fire in Red again. This is the filler.

**Subtractive Palette** <br>
As you perform the 123 combo, you will fill your palette gauge. Every time you cast a 123 spell under Aetherhue 2, you will gain 25 palette gauge. At 50, you can cast Subtractive Palette. This unlocks the more powerful 123 combo that begins with Blizzard in Cyan. You will be able to do 3 attacks with it before you lose your subtractive palette and have to revert back to the other combo. Thanks to the aetherhue stack not being a true combo tracker, you can use Subtractive Palette at any point during your 123 combo without worrying about losing DPS.

**White Paint** <br>
Every time you cast a 123 spell under Aetherhue 2, you will also generate 1 White Paint. This allows you to use Holy in White, which is an instant GCD. Using it over your 123 is a DPS loss so only use it when you need to (moving).

**Motifs** <br>
There are three spells to paint motifs and three spells to use motifs. The canvas gauge keeps track of the motifs you have painted and stored. They have long cast times but are instant casts with short recasts when used outside of combat, so always have them up between fights.

Creature Motif will show on your hotbar as Pom Motif initially. You can paint a pom onto your canvas and then use Living Muse, an instant OGCD, to attack with it. After you paint a pom and cast it, it will go above your canvas and you can then paint a Wing Motif. After painting a wing motif and using it by casting Living Muse, a full Moogle will be painted and you can then cast the OGCD Mog of the Ages.

Weapon Motif will show up on your hotbar as Hammer Motif. You can paint a hammer onto your canvas and then use Steel Muse to activate the spell Hammer Stamp, an instant GCD. Hammer Stamp can be used three times and will eventually upgrade into its own 123 as opposed to repeating Hammer Stamp three times.

Landscape Motif will show up on your hotbar as Starry Sky Motif. You can paint Starry Sky onto your canvas and then cast Starry Sky. This is your raid buff, active every 2 minutes. Not much else to say about it at level 80.

At level 80, swiftcast is best used to paint a motif in combat. I usually use it to cast whichever motif's corresponding spell will be off of cooldown fastest as the painting of the motifs themselves have no recast past their cast time and GCD.
